## 3. Key Trends & Research Findings

1. **Vertical-first agents** – Startups move from general chatbots to domain-specific agents (legal, finance, bio-lab automation).  
2. **Tool-use & “mixture-of-tools”** – Papers on TUMIX and ARE show test-time scaling by letting agents pick APIs or code sandboxes.  
3. **Multi-agent collaboration** – Research focus on role-playing, debate and consensus protocols to raise reasoning accuracy.  
4. **Evaluation crisis** – New benchmarks (AgentBench, GAIA, etc.) appear monthly; community calls for unified eval suites.  
5. **Safety & alignment** – Anthropic’s “computer-use” agents rekindle worries on autonomous action; red-team datasets released.  
6. **Funding bifurcation** – 7 AI agent companies raised ≥$1 B rounds in 2024-25; simultaneously, EU seed rounds shrink, pushing startups toward vertical niches.
