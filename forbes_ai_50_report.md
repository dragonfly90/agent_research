## 3. Key Trends & Take-aways

1. **Coding co-pilots are the first $10 B AI vertical** – Anysphere's Cursor proved consumer-grade tools can scale to half-billion-dollar ARR in <24 mo.  
2. **Valuations now match late-'90s telecom levels** – Anthropic's $380 B and Anysphere's $9.9 B signal an investor flight to perceived "safe" frontier bets.  
3. **Language-learning & other vertical SaaS** (Speak) monetize quickly through mobile subscriptions, even without enterprise sales teams.  
4. **Energy-to-Compute** startups (Crusoe, Lambda) ride GPU shortages, turning power arbitrage into AI cloud margin.  
5. **Big-Tech clouds** counter by bundling models, hardware credits, and serverless tooling—making the "AI agent platform" layer a commodity buyers' market.
